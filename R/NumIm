Number of Imputations- von Hippel 2018 Algorithm


Uses the algorithm generated by von Hippel in 2018 to estimate the number of imputations necessary in a multiple imputation procedure.
It is recommended to use the mice procedure to generate the imputed datasets, model the data, and summarize pooled results in order to 
find the fmi necessary for this function.

NumIm<- function(fmi,cvse) {1+.5*(fmi/cvse)^2}
