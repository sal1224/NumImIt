# NumImIt: Number of Imputations and Iterations
  R package for determining number of iterations and imputations to use with package "MICE"
  The NumImIt package is to be used as a supplement to the mice package when determining the number of imputations and iterations to specify while imputing a cross-sectional dataset.
  While still in development, future directions of this package include implications for longitudinal data with respect to the mitml package.
